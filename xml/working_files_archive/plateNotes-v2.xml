                     represents, at the lower left-hand corner, the friar, in a shaggy or rug
                     mantle, blessing the Irish chief, who, having reverently laid aside his

                     repeated, the chief stooping from his horse to receive it ere he departs. In
                     the centre is represented the chief and his party. He is on horseback, and the
                     rest on foot, armed with pikes and swords. He wears the helmet formerly
                     mentioned, which resembles a mitre, and his leathern quilted jacke appears
                     beneath his shaggy mantle. In the up™ per corner, on the left hand, is the

                     and armed with calivers, are putting the kerne to flight. Beneath, two
