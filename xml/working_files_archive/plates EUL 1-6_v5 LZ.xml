                <p>The project is to transcribe, encode, and publish, for the first time the
                    full-text and plates of John Derricke's The Image of Irelande (1578)</p>

                <correction>
                    <p>The transcription is based on two forms of a document. The base-text was a
                        scan of the plates supplied by the University of Edinburgh Library. The
                        initial transcriptions were made with the online images, but the final
                        transcription was done with reference to the high-quality photos of the
                        document. </p>
                    <p>As far as is possible, a diplomatic edition is intended, so there is a strong
                        orientation towards the physical appearance of each page, including
                        recording such aspects as indentations, centring, brackets, and spaces. All
                        omissions, truncations, deletions, etc. in the original are retained. Text
                        that is indecipherable is marked by the use of the &lt;gap&gt; element. The
                        choice element, containing &lt;orig&gt; paired with &lt;reg&gt; marks text
                        that is in some way possibly erroneous, idiosyncratic, or easily
                        misunderstood with a clarification. Not marked are ligatures, dropped
                        &#145;r&#146;, and long &#145;s&#146;. </p>
                    <p>Punctuation in the copy-text is retained. </p>

                    <!-- add note about capitalization being silently normalized -->
                    <p>Spelling is modernized. The transcription silently replaces the letters
                        &#145;u&#146; for &#145;v&#146;, &#145;i&#146; for &#145;j&#146;, and

                        contractions) are marked as such in both their contracted and expanded
                        forms. Words, wordforms, or compounded words in which letters are elided by
                        the scribe are designated as abbreviations and encoded with the element
                        &lt;abbr&gt; and the attribute expan= recording both the construction of the
                        original and the expanded format. </p>
                    <p>Marginal annotations included within the body of the text are distinguished
                        from editorial annotations, which are encoded with the element &lt;note&gt;
                        and the attribute type= with a description of &#145;annotation&#146; to
                        distinguish marginal from editorial notes, which are encoded with the
                        element &lt;note&gt; and the attribute type= with a description of
                        &#145;editorial.&#146; </p>
                    <p>Personal names of historical interest, mostly of poets or scribes, are
                        identified as such and refer back to a &lt;listPerson&gt; item using a key
                        tag. Within the listPerson descriptions, each person is identified with a
                        ref pointer using the Library of Congress Authority number, and a second URI
                        ref to the Dictionary of National Biography. Modern researchers or scholars
                        who are referred to in the text, including the project team, are listed in a
                        second listPerson element, with the attribute of type="modern". </p>
                    <p>The element &lt;note&gt; is used for additions to the text that are marginal
                        and for editorial notes. They are delineated by first, type (editorial,
                        annotation, marginal), and secondly, place on the page (in the case of a
                        marginal note). </p>
                    <p>The element &lt;gap&gt; records the (possibly temporary) unavailability of a
                        transcription, implying indecipherability, for one reason or another:
                        faintness, obliteration (for example, by an ink blotch), deletion (when it
                        so thorough that the deleted letters cannot be deciphered), invisibility
                        (when the letters enter the spine of the book, erased, or torn. The extent
                        of the indecipherable section is not recorded. The element &lt;supplied&gt;
                        records instances in which a character is supplied by the editor on
                        reasonable grounds that it exists. The element &lt;unclear&gt; is used to
                        identify a transcription that is difficult to ascertain. The element
                        &#147;damage&#148; is used for occasions where the text has suffered some
                        damage, most usually due to ink blots. The element &lt;space&gt; is used to
                        record deliberate gaps left by the scribes, with attribute of extent, with
                        the value indicating the approximate number of characters or lines. </p>
                </normalization>
                <segmentation>
                    <p>In line with the orientation toward the physical aspect of the manuscript,
                        graphical and bibliographical descriptions form an important component of
                        the file. For example, we record details of page presentation, such as torn
                        pages and a repaired leaf and we recognize of the former position of a page.
                        Besides the description of such presentational aspects on a page as
                        centring, indentation, brackets, and spaces is noted. </p>
                    <p>The text as a whole is divided into segments by the use of specialized
                        element tags that record the division points that mark the boundaries
                        between sections, known as milestone type element tags, with reference to
                        the TEI Guidelines (6.9.3). For example, when the text is divided into
                        columns, the point at which a new column begins is marked by a specialized
                        element tag designed for that purpose (&lt;cb/&gt;), with an attribute value
                        of left or right. </p>
                    <p>Despite recognizing divisions into pages, columns, and graphical lines, the
                        principal orientation is into semantic units, poems, generally. The basic
                        unit within the text of as a whole is the individual part or new page
                        (&lt;div&gt;), together with its associated material, such as scribal
                        annotations that appear in proximity to a poem and seem to refer to it. The
                        poetic entity includes some units that are not strictly poems, such as poem
                        fragments, anagram, annotation, figure, epigram, and some collective
                        divisions (&lt;ab&gt; [anonymous block]) in which occur a number of what
                        might be termed miscellaneous graffiti consisting of symbols, initials,
                        words, epigrams, and drawings. Despite the varied nature of the basic
                        division, it is here referred to as a poem.</p>

                    <!--  stopped reading here-->

                    <p>The text of the poem itself is contained within a stanza division (or
                        divisions, if there is more than one), using &lt;lg&gt; (linegroup). Each
                        stanza is numbered sequentially within the poem (unless there is only one).
                        The stanza divisions are according to standard indexes and modern editions
                        (if there is such an edition) because scribal practice is highly variable in
                        both the intention to divide the text into stanzas and the method of doing
                        so. For instance, it is not assumed that scribes leave spaces between
                        stanzas. Sometimes there is no indication as to where one stanza ends and
                        another begins. Sometimes scribes indicate internal divisions with marks in
                        the left margins, the use of majuscule characters, spaces between groupings,
                        or by aligning the first line of a stanza to the left compared to the
                        alignment of the other lines of that stanza. The existence and type of
                        stanza marking (or lack thereof) are described in editorial notes. When a
                        scribe&#146;s presentation of stanzaic divisions differs from that given in
                        standard indexes, the situation is recorded in an editorial note. </p>
                    <p>Each stanza is divided into poetic lines using &lt;l&gt; (poetic line), each
                        of which is numbered sequentially within the poem in an attribute value n=.
                        Lines that are aborted or deleted by a scribe but that are recognizably part
                        of the poem are numbered with half-numbers that indicate their position in
                        the sequence. Lines that are omitted (according to standard indexes and
                        modern editions) are indicated by a row of hyphens, numbered and noted as
                        omissions. Annotations are included as the content of an element
                        &lt;note&gt; with an attribute type="annotation" to distinguish them from
                        editorial notes that have an attribute type of "editorial" and scribal notes
                        that have an attribute type="scribal". Annotations also have an attribute
                        giving their place relative to the poem. Within annotations, if no line
                        divisions are noted by the use of &lt;seg&gt;, it is to be assumed that the
                        annotation is on one graphical line, unless it is marked as being placed
                        'inline.' The poetic lines are occasionally segmented to distinguish, for
                        example, resonant phrases and graphically displaced words and phrases (as
                        mentioned earlier). The element &lt;w&gt; (word) is occasionally used as an
                        alternative when one word is involved in the distinction.</p>
                    <p>The encoding of witnesses follows the practice of the main text, however, the
                        encoding is somewhat simplified. Only the relevant poems are included.
                        Capitalization, abbreviations, deletions, and annotations are recorded. Each
                        witness manuscript or print source is encoded in a single file, which
                        validates to the DTD of the main document. Each witness file can be
                        considered a satellite to the main document file.</p>
                    <p>The header section (which is also simplified) of each witness file includes
                        an index encoded as a &lt;list&gt; of incipits (as they appear in the
                        witness text) arranged alphabetically within a &lt;p&gt; section within a
                        &lt;note&gt; that relates the location of a particular poem instance in the
                        witness to the location within the Devonshire MS., which is repeated in the
                        head section of each division. In addition, each relationship also mentions
                        the other contemporary witnesses to that particular poem as a "See also"
                        section and, when necessary, a designation of how that first line appears in
                        the Devonshire MS, if there are significant differences. The header section
                        includes a detailed description of the original source text used and, in
                        some cases, also includes a description of the source of a modern
                        transcription if that has been used instead, but it does not duplicate the
                        detailed description of encoding practices as is found in the main
                        document.</p>
                    <!-- fix regarding our work<p>The internal structure of each witness file parallels the main file, with a
                        division into a &lt;div&gt; element for each poem, and further divisions
                        into &lt;lg&gt; and &lt;l&gt;. Each poem is given an &lt;id&gt; based on the
                        abbreviation for that particular witness and its position in the sequence of
                        poems transcribed from that witness. For example, AAH01 is the first poem
                        transcribed from the Arundel-Harington MS. witness.</p> -->
