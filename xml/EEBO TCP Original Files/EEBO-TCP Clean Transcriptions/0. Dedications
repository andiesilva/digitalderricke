¶To the right worshipfull Maister Phillip Sidney Esquire, Soonne and heire to the right honourable sir Henry Sidney, Knight of the moste noble order of the Garter, Lorde President of Wales, and Merches of the same, Lorde deputie generall of her highnesse realme in Irelande, and one of her Maiesties moste honourable priuie Counsell in Englande, Ihon Derricke wisheth perfecte felicitie in Christe, AMEN.
COnsideryng with my self (right worshipfull) that it is not onely sufficiente for menne towardes their benefactors, to beare an in¦ward affection, and minde gratulatorie for benefites receiued, but also, that some outward and externall token, of necessitie bee thereto adioyned, liuely to expresse outwardly, the secrete affectes of the same, though notwithstandyng inwarde good will, bee suche an excellent vertue, as who so euer hath it, stādes partly in securitie, but who soeuer hath and expresseth it, to hym is all th•ng made sure: Euen so, and for because I haue euer 
SIG a2v
studied, and imployed my diligence, to flee vnthankefulnesse, that notable vice detested of God and man, and to imbrace gratefulnesse, that heauenly Sacrifice, approued of God, manifestyng it to the whole worlde, in discharge of my duetie towardes my Lorde your father, whom for many respectes, vnfainedly I honour, and in hym to your worship as a pattrē of all benignitie, proceding from so honorable a kindrede, with all semely reuerence I worship, I saie with all humilitie, sinceritie, and integritie of mynde, as a notable argument of my vnfained good will, these my labours beyng the fruites of my trauell, I humblie doe offer, assuryng my self of your fauorable coūtenaunce therein, to whose protection I am so muche the more bolder to commēde them, by how muche I vnderstande your excellent Nature towardes all laudable exercises. And though (peraduenture) some will impute me arrogante, and passyng presumptuous in attemptyng the same: Hauyng respect but onely to the naked partes of the outward gifte and giuer, not waiyng the inward motion of the mynde, whereof the outward accions spryng, nor yet sufficiently ponderyng, that as it is impossible, for fire to be without heate
SIG a3r
or the Sunne without brightnesse, no more can the good meanyng of the good bee for euer repressed, but that at the laste it bursteth forthe & is made manifeste, shewyng it self openly muche like the flames of fire, after a thicke and smouldryng smoke: not yet diligently consideryng, like wise and cunnyng Carpenters, that by how muche the weaker a house and buildyng is, by so muche the stronger ought the postes and pillers to bee, (I saie) thei hauyng regard to none of these thynges, or at the leaste not fullie consideryng theim, neither remembryng how commendable a thyng it is, for euery creature to yeelde his fruite simplye in his naturall kinde, without colouryng or dissimulation, bee it little or muche, but rather castynge their eyes like sencelesse beastes downe to the grounde, chauntyng vppon the outwarde Elementes, damnyng, and condemnyng those externall actions, signes, and tokens, and as vaine, friuolous, and of no effect, yet not withstandyng this maie not discomfort me in that whiche I haue here determined, but that (maugree their beardes) my good will muste appeare, giuyng them to vnderstande, that it is as possible for them, to put the whole seas, into a leather 
SIG a3v
Bottle, and to driue all the Woodkarne of Irelande, into one Shepheardes bagge, or Satchell, as it is to driue me from my pretended purpose, because I knowe it consisteth in your worshippes free choise, and libertie, to make bothe the gifte, and giuer, seeme sufficient worthie, &c. Thus beyng emboldened through fame of your courtesie, with hope of remission for this my temeritie, I duetifullie ende, besechyng God to preserue your worship, in good health, and long life, with muche encrease of worship, and honour, &c. At Dublin her Maiesties cheef Citie in Irelande, xvi. of Iune. M.D.LXXVIII.

¶To the right honourable and my verie good Lordes, the Lordes of her Maiesties realme of Irelande, and to all other in generall of the saied lande, beyng louers of vertue, and imbracers of ciuilitie: grace bee multiplied, and peace euerlastyng.
It maie be thought (right honourable) and likewise be imagined of some, who peraduenture) readyng this my little treatise, of the Image of Irelande, with a conscience corrupted, to bee a thyng deuised and sette forthe, in reproche of all the Nobilitie, and others, borne within this Realme of Irelande, as though the partie, ment nothyng els but a meere contempte of so many Noble, and worshipfull personages, and that this title of Woodkarne, should be but a couert, to shroude hym from suspition of the former allegation: Truth is my very good Lordes, if credite maie bee giuen to the artificer, simply as he meaneth, the substaunce is all one, (the matter I meane) to the verie Title, of that whiche is here called Woodkarne, who dissalowyng their Karnishe maners, affirme their dissolute life, and inordinate liuyng, better to pertaine vnto Infidelles,
SIG a4v
and Heathen, then for those whiche in any respecte professe the name of Christe, (and what Christians thei bee, right honourable iudge ye) wherefore bee ye not then offended, O ye freendes of vertue and imbracers of ciuilitie, that I should so fore lothe, or enuaigh their farre vnseemely maners, settyng out in liuely protractours, in contempnyng the same, bothe their shape, and execrable accions, for (in verie troth) my harte abhorreth their dealynges, and my soule dooeth detest their wilde shamrocke maners, yea so muche the rather, because there is no societie, or fellowship betwene God, and the Deuill, little amitie betwene the Wolfe and the Lambe: like good will, betweene a Rebell, and a faithfull Subiect. Now for as muche then, as thinges with their cōtraries agree not, I moste humblie beseche your courtesies, not to deeme the reprehension of these wilde wantō Woodkarne, to bee spoken of all menne in generall, whiche is here ment but of some, of those I saie, that are Rebelles to our (Queene) enemies to peace, and disturbers of the common wealthe, as for your (Honours) in good tyme bee it spoken, and voide of flatterie recited, who knoweth not, what festination by your Lordshipps hath been vsed, what godlie care taken, what meanes practised, what pollicie shewed, and diligence bestowed at all tymes (as occasiō serued) to serue, accompanied either with the Lorde Deputie, or by your Lordshipps alone, against 
SIG b1r
those whom I haue here tearmed by the name of Woodkarne bestowyng not onely your trauelles, adioyned with greate charges, but also ventred your liues in aduauncyng her Maiesties honor, shewyng thereby, bothe a constant faithe, a perfecte fidelitie, to her royall Croune, conflictyng by force of maine batteil, many of these monsters, beeyng sworne enemies to her noble grace, the attempte whereof was laudable, and the action meritorious, before GOD and man. This I truste maie suffice (right honourable) your noble wisedomes, to withdraw all sinister suspicions from your suppliant, and his booke, giuyng full credite, my purposed intent is not, neither yet euer was, to blemishe any mannes renowne, (beeyng approued seruitours to her moste noble and dreadfull scepter) whose continuaunce, I praie GOD, maie bee long and ioyfull, peaceable as the daies of Salomon, copyng with the long yeres of Nestor, to gouerne us her people, with an admirable regimente, and ouer her foes, triumphantly to raigne. Amen. God blesse your honours, with all maner of spirituall, and yearthly blessynges, the fauour, and loue of God and manne, muche honour in your countrie: and to conclude, life euerlastyng &c. 
Your honours moste humble Ihon Derricke.

¶ To the good and gentle Reader in all places wheresoeuer, but especially, to my louing countrimen of Enlande, hartie salutations, and greetyng euer.
DIuers were the causes (good Reader) that moued me first to take in hande, the caruyng forthe of this Image, and lastly to commende it to thy gentle deuotion, hoping, that as with no small labour, and trauel I haue finishte, and brought it to this perfection, and with no lesse willyng consent, and single mynde haue made it seruiceable at thy good pleasure to vse, so likewise on thy part, thou wilte freendly accept the same, entertainyng it as a straunger, or messenger come from a farre Countrey, simplie to report, and deliuer vnto thee, the state and condition of his saied Countremen the Woodkarne, without any imparyng of their credites, the more notable members of the same, who differyng from theim, in their rusticall •udenesse, doe agree wholie with vs, in all laudable discipline. Touching whiche causes, though thei bee many, and as I saied before diuerse, twoo yet especially, I thought good to signifie, whereof, the one came of a duetifull affection, and vnfarned good will (drawne of long continuaunce through graces receiued) towardes his persone, whiche vndoubtedly I honor, and the other of a bounden duetie, (through loue inseparable) towardes my natiue Countrey: Or whiche twoo, though either of them were sufficient to moue any man (if he were not a forgetfull persone) to like indeuer, yet seeyng thei are variable, and bothe of them so laudable, I might in no wise slacken my pretended 
SIG	b2r
purpose, but shewe my hartie good will, bothe to freende and countrie. If you therefore (my beloued countrimen) for whose sakes (as I saied before partely I framed it, and for whose greater delight, I haue clothed it with varietie, shall deeme it worthie of your custodie, or receiue thereby any profitable, pleasure, I obtaine not onely my expectation, touchyng suche courtesie, but also full recompence, of all my whole charges, (who doubtlesse accoumpte theim nothyng, to pleasure either partie). And if (by waie of digression) some peraduenture (whose iudgementes are parciall in other mennes labours) shall cauill at this my imprinted Image, or impugne the thinges therein contained (as reportyng matters of vntrouthe) especially the third lease of this discouered Woodkarne, affirmyng no suche rudenesse, in these our daies to bee practised with the rudeste of that moste barbarous Nacion, to suche I replie (crauyng their pacience) saiyng, that it is not our Englishe Pale, whiche in any respecte I haue touched, nor yet those of the Southe, whom I haue impeched, nor yet of the Weste, whom I haue nipped, but a people out of the Northe, whose vsages I beholde after the fashon there sette doune, and those are thei whom I haue detected, shadowyng notwithstandyng parte of their maners with flowres of that Countrey, and least peraduenture ye might muse whom I meante, I will not be curious in dischargyng my conscience, lettyng you vnderstande, that thei are a people sprong from Macke Swine, a barbarous ofspring, come from that Nation, whiche maie bee perceiued by their Hoggishe fashion: So as my beloued countrimen, and well desposed Reader, if wilfulnesse blinde not the fightes of your iudgementes) it manifestly appeareth, and maie easely bee coniectured, that it is not againste any one good member of this Common wealthe of Irelande, that I haue made my discouerie, but onely against the pernicious Uipers of the saied lande, whiche thing I wish hartely eche one to beleue, and credite, knowyng (for example sake) that warre is not waged, against the Queenes freendes, not yet a battell fought, saue onely against her enemies, which
SIG b2v
if you so credite, and therewithall accepte of my trauelles, (whiche do represent my vnfained good will) I leaue not this simplie as a pledge of a further beneuolence with you, but therewithall doe paune euen my credite, for accomplishyng my promesse, till whiche tyme farewell as your hartes can desire.
Yours as his owne Ihon Derricke.
