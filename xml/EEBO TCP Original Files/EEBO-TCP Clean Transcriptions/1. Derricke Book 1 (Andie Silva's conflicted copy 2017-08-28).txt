Derricke, John

The first parte of the Image of Irelande.
 THe * heauenly God puissant Prince,
the'ternall kyng of grace:
The lorde which rules both heauen & yearth,
with his Imperiall mace.
Whiche caused first the cristall Skies,
in liuely formes appeare,
And by the course of glistryng Pheabe,
deuided eke the yeare.
Whiche did the lothsome Chaos part,
and separate a sonder:
And plaste the yearth aboue the Sease,
for mortall men to wonder.
Whiche gaue commaundement to the same,
in Natures perfect kinde.
To multiply and yelde the'ncrease,
to those that came behinde:
(Whiche was to man as then not made,
a famous creature sure:)
Of all the woorkes of mightie Ioue,
(renowmed rare and pure:)
Whiche gaue hym reason from aboue,
his will to vnderstande:
Upholdyng heauen and yearth likewise,
with his moste holie hande.
Whiche did reduce from bale to blisse,
the wretched state of man:

SIG --
And in exchange the sacred heauens,
allotted to hym than.
(Not for the good desartes he sawe,
in mortall fleshe to be:
But meerly of his owne accorde,
that grace extenden he.)
Whiche made the seate of Brittishe kynges,
with honour to abounde:
And eke their iuste deserued fame,
through glom'ryng worlde to sounde.
Suppressyng all their mortall foes,
that vp against them rose:
And by the force of bloodie blade,
afflicted euer those.
*This sondrie Lands can testifie,
as stories witnesse yeeld:
And wee the fruite thereof doe reape,
as from a fartile feeld.
Whiche to relate in this discourse,
I deme it not amisse:
Because I iudge the same to shewe,
*a pleasant storie is.
* And to beginne with Marses knight,
that mightie man of of warre:
Whose fame might not suffice the worlde,
but peerst the highest Starre.
Who now though shrowded in the yearth,
with bodie tournd to claye:
Yet euer liuyng with the iuste,
and shall from daie to daie.
Who neuer made his backe retourne,

SIG
once enterde in the feeld:
Till he had made the stoutest foes,
their stately Scepters yeeld.
And brought by Marciall force of armes,
their honour to the duste:
By pluckyng doune their cheefest staies,
whereon their hope did truste,
Prince Arthure is that noble kyng,*
whose fame and greate reporte:
Stirde vp the Nobles of the worlde,
to seeke vnto his Courte.
This is the Prince whose courage stout,
his credite did aduaunce:
This is the man that raignde as Kyng,
in Britaine and in Fraunce.
This is the knight whose bloodie blade,
obtained Caesars Croune:
This is the man that brought at laste,
the haughtie Romanes doune.
This is that thrice renowmed knight,
whom stories doe commende:
This is the Prince whose fame and name,
Dame honour doeth defende.
Thus here of this victorious knight,
I make a small ende:
And to the kyngs of like renowne,
in later yeres descende.
Wherefore attentiue Lordyngs bee,
your listnyng eares to fill:
For breefly of them will I speake,
accordyng to my skill.

SIG --
And as with Arthure I beganne,
so will I here proceade:
* To write of Henries noble name,
the seconde as I reade.
To shewe his magnanimitie,
in wrightyngs comprehended,
And other graces specially,
in Chronicles remembred.
For he it is whiche mightily,
augments our Countries fame:
And in his tyme moste roially,
defended eke thesame.
He is that seconde Salomon,
as writynges doe importe,
Whiche filde all corners of the worlde,
with fame of his reporte.
Whiche moude bothe Kyngs & Emperours,
and Princes farre and neare:
To drawe vnto his noble Court,
his wisedome for to heare.
* For why, his domes were purely giuen,
in matters of debate:
He was an vmpere equally,
to euery kinde of state.
He forste not principallitie,
nor yet regarded might:
In eu'ry cause especially,
respected he the right.
For whiche his actions purely doen,
by wisedomes rules approued:
Of Princes, Kynges, and Emperours,

SIG
he highly was beloued.
Thus was he counted in his daies,
the wisest vnder Sonne:
Through Europe and beyonde those partes,
so farre his fame did ronne.
And as for his possessions,
so largely thei extended:
As neuer Prince before nor since,
had like as is remembred.
O Kyng these thynges assuredly,
deserue to be enrolde:
And grauen in tables sumptuously
made all of beaten golde.
* But did the glorie of the Realme,
from thence forth ginne to cease?
Or did it not like the Lawrell tree,
in freshnesse still increase?
Did not the Princes of the same,
by Marciall actes maintaine?
The garlande of immortall fame,
that others earst did gaine?
Goe looke and searche the monumentes,
and there you shall beholde:
That there their names emong the beste,
dame Honour hath enrolde.
There shall you see the famous Prince,
in prease of worthies stande:
Euen cheeke by cheeke to mightie Mars,
with dreadfull sworde in hande.
There shall you see dame Honour braue,
amide the golden raies:

SIG
This noble prices banner vaunce,
to his eternall praise.
Prince Edward is that noble Knight,*
the third Kyng of that name:
Approued in the Misteries,
of Marses warlike game.
This is the Prince whose roiall acts,
were knowne by sea and lande:
This is the knight whose presence durste,
no forraine Kyng withstande.
This is the prince whose cōquryng sworde,
possest a double Croune:
This is the manne that made his foes,
on euery side come doune.
* This is the manne whose valiant harte,
for triall of his right:
Did proffer gainst the Romishe Pope,
euen hande to hande to fight.
But durste the Popes heroicall harte,
take thoffer of the Kyng?
No, no, the foole was wise enough,
he feard an other thyng.
He knewe that if he had assaied,
to tempt hym in his rage:
That captiue should he yeeld hym self,
or leaue his harte to gage.
Wherefore to saue his credite then,
he knewe no waie but one:
Whiche was to take the Keyes, and leaue
the sworde to hym a lone.
For Peter needes must silence keepe,

SIG
when Paule steppes forthe in place:
And knowe we not how Paule withstoode,
sainct Peter to his face?
This thyng importes a misterie,
of whiche here to dispute:
I purpose not, but leaue the same,
for others to confute.
Yet might I saie my minde therein
as some before haue doen:
But that I see the daie forbiddes,
and tyme is almoste ronne.
I see how Nox her self applies,
to shade sir Phebus light.
But let the toothlesse crabbed queane,
boyle in her owne despight.
Yea let her euer frettyng liue,
and pinyng fade awaie:
A iuste reward for suche a drabbe,
her mallice to bewraie.
But as for Phebe, you holie ones,
graunt he maie flourishe still:
And to the endyng of my worke,
Lorde guide my quiuryng quill.
When thus this high and mightie Prince,*
whose glorie did extende:
Throughout all corners of the worlde,
euen to the furthest ende.
Had rulde, and rainde, and wealde the mace,
and Scepter of this lande:
Long tymes and daies and many yeres,
as wrighters beare in hande.
At length as all thyngs hath a tyme,

SIG
to spryng, to growe, and crease:
And backe againe in elder yeres,
to wither, fade, and cease.
Muche like the sweete and pleasant hearbe,
or fragrant sentiue flowre:
That riseth brauely for a tyme,
and falleth in an howre.
Or as the auncient aged Oke,
sometyme of passyng strength,
But yet through sondrie winters stormes,
a feeble tree at length.
Or rather like the gallant Sunne,
(that golden firie ball:)
Whiche hauyng past the toppe of heauen,
declineth to the fall.
Euen so this famous peerlesse prince,
(that precious pearle of price:)
Through all the hostes and cope of heauen,
(renowmed famous thrice.)
At laste by Death arested was,
and forced to resigne:
The thynges he conqu'red by the sworde,
as whiche from royall line.
Did erst descend, surrendring them
to other noble Kynges:
Whose praises all eche sacred Dame,
in heauenly ditties synges.
*Emongest the whiche (though thei deserue,
to haue immortall fame:)
Yet here of one his praise to wright,
it ioyes my hande to frame.

SIGN
*It gladdes my harte to name hym once,
to bryng hym forthe in place:
For hym that onely durst des•e,
his enemies to their face.
* He, he it is, and none but he,
in these our latter daies:
Through Europe, and beyonde partes,
hath wonne like noble praise.
Kyng Henry that moste famous Prince,
the eight I meane by name:
Whiche left behinde hym for his deedes,
so high renowme and fame.
This is the Prince whose onely lookes,
made diuerse Nations quake:
This is the manne that made likewise,
huge towres and holds to shake.
*This is the Prince that did retaine,
the Emp'rour in his bande:
This is that knight that made his foes,
to feele his heauie hande.
*This is the Prince that of hymself,
did holde the stately Croune:
This is the manne that durst attempt,
to throwe the Papistes doune.
This is the Prince that freedome got,
to this his Countrie soile:
This is the manne that put the Pope,
and Popishe foes to foile.
This is the manne that made his Bulles,
goe flittyng doune the streames:
And thrust out all his peltyng trashe,

SIG
*out of his highnesse Realmes.
This is the manne whose roiall actes,
haue wonne eternall fame:
Emongest the sainctes and sonnes of men,
deseruyng well the same.
But yet O Kyng especially,
thrice famous art thou calde:
Through her whiche in the self same throne
of honour now is stalde.
I meane our (gracious soueraigne Queene,
that sacred virgine pure:)
Whose raigne God graunt th•ice Nestors ye∣res,
with honour to endu•e.
This is the Prince whos• worthie fame,
doeth liue and raigne for euer:
This is the Queene whose noble name,
can bee defaced neuer.
This is the Prince whiche in her daies,
wrought wonders in her lande:
And made her foes like heards of Sheep•,
amazed for to stande.
This is the Prince whose sacred arme.
hath wounded so the Pope:
That to recouer his former strength,
he liueth voide of hope.
This is the Prince whiche to her Realmes,
procureth reste and peace:
This is the Queene that causeth warres,
and bloodie broiles to cease.
This is the Prince that little cares,
to hazarde life or blood.

SIG
This is the Queene that nothyng spares,
to doe her people good.
O giftes of rare varietie,
adornyng Princes grace:
Stande vp eternall memorie,
Elizas fame to blaze.
O perfect magnanimitie,
thy fame continue euer:
As doeth the Sonne in circled Skies,
who•••ight decreaseth neuer.
And euerla••••• maiest thou liue,
to 〈…〉
To whiche 〈…〉 saie,
vnfainedly 〈…〉
O praie for her 〈◊〉,
you people of her lande:
That God maie prosper happely,
what so she takes in hande.
That God maie fauor graciously,
the things she hath begonne:
That she with vs, and we with her
a blessed race maie ronne.
In this as in all other thyngs,*
th'almighties will be doen:
Since nothyng maie preuent his grace,
or godlie purpose shonne.
For why? he is that self same God,
that neuer alters kinde:

SIG
(A God I saie moste excellent,
and of a constant minde.)
Whiche neuer doeth forsake the thyng,
once tane in his protection:
Nor yet reiecteth vtterly,
whiche is in his election.
(He is a God omnipotent)
on whom the world dependeth:
Whose vigor, force, and celsitude,
through eu'ry part extendeth.
(A roiall God immencible)
that can not be enclined:
To chaunge from all eternitie,
his sacred purpose minded.
But that whiche his Deuinitie,
before all ages formed:
In his eternall secresie,
shall doubtlesse be performed.
*This holie and immortall God,
euen he I must confesse:
Did stirre me vp moste studiously,
my senses to addresse.
To write some pleasant historie,
I musyngly began:
*For to consider warely,
of what it should be than.
I was no fitte Astronomer,
to treate vpon the Starres:
Nor yet trainde vp in Marsis court,
to tell of bloodie warres.
I was no famous Oratour,

SIG
nor craftie manne of Lawe:
*Whiche from a but of Muskadine,
a tunne of Malmessies drawe.
Nor yet recounted excellent,
in those high mist'ries seuen:
By whiche I might vpon myne othe,
tell what is doen in heauen.
I was not of God Neptunes Court,
as Pirates be on sease:
I deemde it farre a better life,
(though poore) to liue at ease.
* I was not skilful in their trades
whiche giue out golde to gaine:
No, no, I dare auouche suche sainctes,
my pouche did neuer staine.
Nor yet with Marchant venterers,*
(those were too high for me:)
Unneath to shewe their famous sleight,
acquainted might I bee:
I founde not in me verelie,
of wrighters that's required:
How might I then performe the thyng,
my soule and harte desired?
But he that worketh all in all,
did will me forward venter:
And he would aide me warlike wise,
strong towres and holdes to enter.
Whereon I tooke suche harte of grace,
as with a ioyfull minde:
I marched forthe in stedfast hope,
some good successe to •inde.

SIG
In whiche my trauells suerly,
he did so we•l attende me:
As nothyng could bee deemed fit,
but forthwith did he sende me.
He gaue me to associate,
a chosen Crewe of Dames
*Inuention, with good Memorie,
these were their perfect names.
To whom Conueighaunce was adioyned,
as Corp'rall to the bande:
Conuaiyng eche thyng pretily,
what so thei tooke in hande.
With these I venterde forwardlie,
to prosecute with speede:
What so my harte assuredlie,
had long before decreed.
*And hauyng now the lothsome goulfe,
of deepe Dispaire well paste:
We did approche Thelysiane feelds,
of comfort at the laste.
Where all the Crewe of heauenly Dames,
with one consent beganne:
To sit them doune, and on my cause,
aduisedly to scanne.
In whiche high court of Parlament,
it was concluded on:
That of the famous Irishe soile,
I should enlarge vpon.
*And least thereof in any parte,
I might relate a misse:
By reason of the longitude,

SIG
or latitude, there is.
A goodly braue Piramides,
erected passyng high:
From whence all corners of the lande,
I might at large discrie.
From whence I did behold and see,
moste noble slowyng streames:*
Fit for the Marchantes of the worlde,
to saile from forraine Realmes.
Wherein were sondrie store of beastes,
in waters that doe liue:
To whom their proper names I am,
vnable for to giue.
Yet were thei suche as doe maintaine,
and serue for common wealth:
By yeeldyng plentie to the soile,
where store of people dwelth.
Yea suche and suche (if credite maie,
be giuen vnto me than:)
As doe refreshe the hongrie soule,
and serue the vse of man.
All whiche I sawe abondantlie,
a loose where I did stande:
*But farre more brauer things then those,
vpon the stable lande.
I there beheld how •urie parte,
and percell was conuaide:
With hills, an• woods & champion ground,
moste artificiall laide.
The hills d•rectly ronnyng forthe,
and turnyng in a genne:

SIG
Muche like a sort of croked mates,
and ouertwhartyng menne.
* The woodes aboue and neath those hills,
some twentie miles in length:
Rounde compaste with a shakyng bogge,
a forte of passyng strength.
From whence a certaine fire is drawne,
to sheeld from Winters colde:
Whereas Poh Morishe hides hymself,
as in a fenced holde.
* The Nimphes of sondrie matrones, I
haue hard doe there resorte:
As tyme and fitt occasions serue,
to vse for their disporte.
Some for to shade them from the heate,
and some an other thyng:
Accordyng as the raine doeth fall,
so doe the flowers spryng.
One doeth reioyce to spende the daie,
in plaiyng Barlibrake.
An other doeth (I meane no harme)
as greate a comfort take.
This Nimphe doeth ioye to scudd a longest,
the woode and riuerse side:
But she in snortyng in a bushe,
Receiu'th as greate a pride.
These doe inuite the Murm'ryng brookes,
these diue and rise againe:
And bathyng in their sweete delightes,
so long thei doe remaine.
Till Cupid toul'th his sacryng bell,

SIG
to enter other Rites:
Ah would'treuiue a manne halfe dedde?*
to see those naked Sprites?
To see what games thei can deuise,
and sondrie pastymes make:
Twould cause I doe assure you,
a Horse his halter brake.
To daunce attendaunce on those Dames▪
with reuerent seruice then:
To waight vpon them in that case.
it forceth sondrie men.
*O Nimphes of lastyng Memorie,
your vertuous actions rare:
With Venus for integritie,
I freely maie compare.
With Venus for agilitie,
(speake I of veniall sinne:)
In her celestiall paradice,
ought you to enter in.
*For you are thei whiche store the ground,
with fruites of your encrease:
And make it daiely to abounde,
(meane I with rest and peace?)
With little Nimphes and mountaine Gods
transformed now and then:
From Bores to Beares, and yet sometyme,
resemblyng honest men.
From whēce there flowes as from a spring,
an other generation:
*More subtill then the Foxes are,
in their imagination.

SIG
Who as thei growe in elder yeres,
and springyng rise in strength:
So doe thei worke the Realmes anoye,
and hinderaunce at the length.
So doe thei worke the landes decaie,
procuryng what thei canne:
The ruine and vndoyng quight,
of many an honest manne.
*This is a thyng that euery one,
had neede to looke vpon:
For els too late the doore is shutte,
when as the steede is gone.
And since the pale is often plag'de,
with suche a hellishe sorte:
Let that suffice, and let vs all,
be warnde by true reporte.
So shall wee shonne the dangrous snares,
our secret foes haue sette:
And ouerpasse the hunters toiles,
and Foulers craftie nette.
So shall wee flie the traitrous grinnes,
that treasons might procure:
And in a towre of strong defence,
our safties all assure.
*Wee knowe by good experience,
it is a daungerous thyng:
For one into his naked bedde,
a poysning Tode to bryng.
Or els a deadly Crocadile,
when as he goeth to reste:
To lead with hym, and as his mate,

SIG
to place next to his breste.
The mischeef thereof certainly,
is this that doeth ensewe:
Euen nothyng but a •odain death,
to carelesse persones dewe.
Then since the harme is manifest,
consent with willyng minde:
To ridde your handes from suche a sorte,
for Catte will after kinde.
And be not witched euermore,
with their externall sight:
For why should men of Th'englishe pale,
in suche a Crewe delight?
Or eke repose suche confidence,
in that vnhappie race:
Since mischeef lurketh oftentimes
euen in the smothest face?
Be not deceiude,* preuent the worst,
the beste shall saue them selues:
And giue not you, your liues to keepe,
to suche dissemblyng Elues.
Els if you doe, (as practise proues,
in these vnconstant daies:)
You doe but trust your mortall foes,
and seeke your owne decaies.
This is my dome and counsell eke,
imbrace it who so can:*
And to retourne vnto my texte,
I deme it wisedome than.
Within the compasse of this land,
no poysonyng beast doeth liue:

SIG
To Adder, Snake, nor Crocadile,
no respitte doeth it giue.
Whereby thesame repast maie take
to feede his appetite:
But with a deadly percyng blowe,
eche vermine it doeth smite.
As sone as thei doe touche the grounde,
euen by and by thei dye:
And hope of longer life to liue,
from euery one doeth flye.
*For where tyme past it did possesse,
eche hurtfull wicked beast:
The hissing serpent with her mate,
and worme of poyson least.
Yet now no suche it will retaine,
it voucheth not to see:
The Frogge, the Tode, nor Uiper vile,
within her boundes to bee.
*If tyme haue chaunged thus the ground,
I stande therein in doubt:
Or whether that the Goddes them selues,
haue driuen those Serpentes out.
For thynges fore knowne to mightie Ioue,
whiche after should ensewe:
Or for preseruyng of some graftes,
whiche there at that tyme grewe.
Or if perhappes thei ment to place,
the wandryng Huntresse theare:
Through hilles & dales the wolfe to chace,
in steade of Sauage Beare.
Or if it were for Iunos sake,

SIG
who happlie begg'de the same:
In pasture for her newe giuen Cowe,
(that Io. Greekishe dame.)
Or if it hapte when thondryng fame,*
did pearce the stately Skies:
Affirmyng troupes of mortall men,
in warlike sorte to rise.
With engens framed for the nonce,
the sacred Turrettes hie:
In maugre Ioue, and Ioues despight,
by force and pollicie.
To take, and make the same a place,
mischaunces to expell:
If afterward by fatall happe,
should happe them ought but well.
I thinke when as suche brutes were made,*
then goddes bothe greate and small:
Consulted with th'infernall ghostes,
and mountaine Sprites withall.
How and what sorte thei might repulse,
or bryng to small effecte:
The worldes entent that would so vile,
dame Natures lawes reiecte.
In whiche consult one stepped forthe,
(as farre as I can gesse:)
Apollo was that reuerende sire,
cheef in this businesse.
Who saied, you goddes that rul dome holde,
aboue the circled Skie:
Let out the threates of fadyng men,*
your graces terrifie.

SIG
*In sothe saied Mars (whose curled lokes,
did shade a doubtie face:)
Appolloes councell noble is,
and fruitfull in this case.
For why should wee that moulded man,
of man be thus a fraied?
Or for the soonnes of mortall men,
so greatly bee dismaied?
*If man by sleight should scale the heauens,
wee goddes maie thinke no wonder,
To see the highest God of all,
to spoile them by his Thonder.
But if wee would deferre no tyme,
for feare of worser happes:
But shunne asmuche as in vs lieth
the brunte of after clappes.
*Let worthie Ioue in Irefull rage,
restraine them by his might:
And suffer half his thonder boltes,
vpon their pates to light.
*Peace (saied Apollo) conqu'ryng Mars,
that were not wisest lore:
For Ioue to spende his warlike boltes,
if you beholde the store.
And now the cicloppes are decaied
(whose connyng science sure:
Could make the seate of mightie Ioue,
for euer to endure.)
But if that ye will liste awhile,
and harken my deuice:
I will relate a better waie,

SIG
whiche doubtlesse maie suffice.
There be a Crewe of mountaine gods,*
possessyng yearth belowe:
Praie that their Godheades would a fewe,
of Marshall men bestowe.
To keepe (saie ye) a little plat,
in whiche is moste mistrust:
And through whiche the forain foe
perforce there trauell must.
For it is next the Articke Pole,
it houes you keepe it well:
And no deuice maie serue so fitte,
their mallice to expell.
Though god Apollo spake full wise*
Mars ganne againe replie:
My soueraigne Lordes let reason yet,
haue superioritie.
Since Marshall knightes haue felt the tast,
of Fortunes sweete and sowre:
As those that fight in Princes cause,
doe taste it daie and howre.
How maie the Goddes that hills posses,
graunt this vniust requeste?
Or who would deeme Apollo sage,
had follie in his breste?
Knowe ye not in that sauage soile,*
the Adder there to dwell?
And see you not the Coccatrice,
and sleyng Serpent fell?
Behold you not the Sloworme there,
with Uipers generation?

SIG
Maie ye not see the Frogge and Tode,
there haue their procreation?
Cannot eche wight (except the blinde)
the sauage beastes perceiue?
As Lion, Wolfe, and rau'nyng Beare,
whose heardes thei oft deceiue?
The tamelesse Panther them emongest,
With Tygers cruell kinde?
The Leoparde with a thousande more,
as Nature hath assignde?
*How then maie man haue companie, with
this hurtfull generation?
Or soonnes of men with noysome worm's▪
enioye their consolation?
*Why (saied Apollo) angrie Mars,
eche parte maie well agree:
When as by Ioue eche sleayng beast▪
abstracted thence shalbe.
Ioue first shall banishe quite the bests
yea he shall cleane destroye:
The thing that might in any wise,
the Souldiers ought anoye.
And thei debarred once from thēce,
in •aufe Securitie:
The Souldiers then in open field,
by daie and night maie lye.
To watche and ward, least Irefull foes,
through Pilgrimes •lye pretence:
Should vnawares against the Gods,
their warlicke sute commence.
Yea thei maie sleepe in bushe or hedge,

SIG
for safetie shall be suche:
As neither Snake nor Lion fearce
their slombryng corpes shall touche.
A mantill maie suffice to shroude,*
their lethie naked skinne:
And heare long growne maie serue full well,
to lappe their noddells in.
In deede (saied Mars) it maie be so,*
if Ioue thereto agree:
But first tis meete that euery hill,
in leauell sorte should bee.
Be whishte (O Mars) saied thondryng Ioue,*
Apollo in degree:
The seconde to my sacred self,
I hould hym next to bee.
Hath saied, what might suffice eche one,
whose far forcastyng witte:
Preuenteth daungers euen at hande,
as els not extant yet.
Eche hurtfull beast that noysome is,
I will commaunde awaie:
Not one shall reste the Mountaine men,
by any kinde to fraie.
The crokyng Tode that ougly semes,
with Snakes and Adders fell:
Shall be desmiste and sent forthe with,
to Plutos ghostes in hell:
To feede thereon, them selues to glutte,
sufficyng hongrie mawe:
Yea thei them selues without constraint,
them selues shall thether drawe.

SIG
Let therefore little Mountaine Gods,
a troupe (as thei maie spare:)
Of breachlesse men at all assaies,
bothe leauie and prepare.
*With Mantelles doune vnto the Shoe,
to lappe them in by night:
With speares and swordes and little dartes
to sheeld them from despight.
And let some haue their breaches close,
to nimble thynges annexte:
With safer meanes to daunce the Boggs,
when thei by foes are vexte.
*With glibbed heddes like Mars hym self,
their malice to expresse:
With Irefull hartes and bloudie hands,
soone prone to wickednesse.
Ioue spake, twas doen and I suppose,
then Serpents were dismiste:
And sent awaie, whiche to be true,
now credite if ye liste.
(Againe) the Irishe yong and old,
presumeth for to saie:
*Their sainct (S. Patricke) was the man,
that banishte them awaie.
And therefore is S, Patricke held
in passyng admiration:
Still worshipped of all that stocke,
with holie veneration.
No beast that noyeth mortall man,
is procreated theare:
*It brynges forthe no Lion feare,

SIG
nor yet the rau'nyng Beare.
No beastes (I saie) whiche do possesse,
one iote of crewell kinde:
Excepte the Wolfe that nosome is,*
in Irishe soile I finde.
But as for other sortes of beastes,*
delightyng mortall eye:
Therein consistes her chefest praise,
who maie it here denye?
First for gallant stouryng Steede,
mans helpe at all assaies:
And next for Neate, whereby his life,
is lengthned sondrie waies.
Dame Venus hath a portion eke,
obseruyng well her tourne:
Restoryng that whiche tracte of tyme,
and withred age hath worne?
What this should be my mistresse deare,
can construe verie well:
Who vsyng it in tyme of neede,
sore combattes doth refell
And now as touchyng featherd Foules,*
and birdes of eche degree:
The nomber doeth extende so farre,
that tis too hard for me.
The multitude thereof to knowe,
or shewe in plaine prospecte:
Because I am no God at all,
my cunnyng hath defecte.
Of haukes which retaining sondrie names,*
the Countrie store doeth breede:

SIG
Whose names if Pacience will abide,
in order shall proceede.
*The Goshauke first of the Crewe,
deserues to haue the name:
The Faucon next for high attemptes,
in glorie and in fame.
The Tarsell then ensueth on,
good reason tis that he:
For fliyng haukes in Ireland next
the Faucon plaste should bee.
The Tarsell gentels course is nexte,
the fourth peere of the lande:
Combined to the Faucon, with
a louers freendly bande.
The pretie Marlion is the fifth,
to her the Sparhauke nexte,
And then the Iacke and Musket laste,
by whom the birds are vexte.
These are the Haukes whiche cheefly breed,
in fertile Irishe grounde:
*Whose matche for flight and speedie wyng,
elswhere be hardly founde.
(And to conclude) of feathered foules,
there breeds the cheef of all:
*A mightie foule, a goodlie birde,
whom men doe Eagle call.
This builde her neast in highest toppe,
of all the Oken tree:
Or in the craftiest place, whereof
in Irelande many bee.
Not in the bounds of Englishe pale,

SIG
whiche is a ciuill place:
But in the Deuills Arse, a Peake,
where Rebells moste imbrace.
For as this foule and all the reste,
are wilde by Natures kinde:
So do thei kepe in wildest Nokes
and there men doe them finde.
For like to like the Prouerbe saith,*
the Leoparde with the Beare:
Doth liue in midest of desarts rude
and none doeth other feare.
For as the Irishe Karne be wilde,
in maners and in fashion:
So doe these foules enhabite, with
that crooked generation.
Yet when as thei are taken yong,
(though wilde thei be by kinde:)
Enstructed through the Fauconers lure,*
by triall good I finde.
That thei doe come as twere at becke,
and when as thei doe call:
She scarce will stint on twige or bowe,
till on his fiste she fall.

SIG
Thus thei obey their tutors hestes
and doe degenerate:
From wildnesse that belonged to,
their forepossessed state.
*But Irishe Karne vnlike these foules,
in burthe and high degree:
No chaunglyngs are thei loue nowhit,
in Ciuill state to bee,
*Thei passe not for ciuilitie,
nor care for wisedomes lore:
*Sinne is their cheef felicitie,
whereof thei haue the store.
And if perhappes a little Ape,
be taken from the Henne:
And brought frō Boggs to chāpion ground,
suche thyngs happe now and then.
*Yea though thei were in Courte trainde vp,
and yeres there liued tenne:
Yet doe thei loke to shaking boggs,
scarce prouyng honest menne.
And when as thei haue wonne the Boggs,
suche vertue hath that grounde:
*That thei are worse then wildest Karne,
and more in synne abounde.
*O holie sainct, O holie man,
O man of God I saie:
O Patrick chiefe of all these Karne
if I speake to thee I maie.
What moued thee, the wriglyng Snake,
and other wormes to kill?
What caused thee on sillie beastes,

SIG
to woorke thy cruell will?
What thyng incenst thee for to strike,
them with thy heauie hande?
When as thou leftest more spitefull beastes,*
within this fertile lande.
Thou smotest the S•rpentes venimous,
and Furies didst subuerte:
And yet the footers of the boggs,*
couldst thou no whit conuerte?
Couldst thou not bryng them to thy bende,
nor bowe them like a Bowe?
Doeth not the Parsone teache his Clarke,
his duetie for to knowe?
But thou good man enstructedst them,*
in schoole of Uertues lore:
Though thei thy holie counsells did,
like gracelesse graftes abhorre.
Thou tookest paine them to reduce,
vnto a godlie state:
But could thy meanes preuaill where Ioue,*
smightes with a curelesse fate?
Can Phisickes arte restore the lame,
or make the blinde to see?
When as the Lorde of hostes doeth saie,
this wretche was plagued by me?
No, no, I dare auowe the same,
doe Phisicke what it can:
In eche respecte it must confesse,*
it self a mortall man.
No Pies to plucke the Thatch from house,
are breed in Irishe grounde:

SIG
*But worse then Pies, the same to burne,
a thousande maie be founde.
Whiche will not sticke without remorse,
whole tounes for to deuoure:
*Committing house and housholde stuffe,
to Sulphers mightie powre.
Consuming corne and cattel bothe
(O heauie tale to tell)
Like Sathans ympes regardyng nought,
the endlesse paines of hell.
Who beyng growne to sappie strength,
long norishte in their synne:
*Suppose by plaiyng of suche partes,
eternall ioyes to winne.
*O pleasaunt lande deformed through,
the life of Irishe Karne:
*O peruerse flocke that hell nor heauen,
from liuyng ill many warne.
O frettyng Bores more bloudier then
the Wolfe, or sauage beare:
*Was neuer beast more brutishe, like
lesse voide of soueraignes feare.
*No men so bare of heauenly grace,
more foes to Countries soile:
Nor traitours that doe more reioyce,
when thei their neighbours spoil.
*No monsters louyng lesser peace,
delightyng more in warre:
Nor Rebe•ls seekyng feller waies,
a common wealthe to marre.
*No wight regardyng vertue lesse,

SIG
more prone to sinfull lust:*
Nor creatures liuyng vnder heauen,
that men maie worser trust.
*God tourne them to a better life:
reformyng whattes a misse,
For man maie not comprice the same,
tis not in handes of his.
If cunnyng had preuailed ought,
or toile might winne the game:
Then Sidney had through labours paine,*
long since atchiu'd the same.
If execution of the Lawes,
could make them to repent:*
Or Princes grace ablating crimes
might c•use their hartes relent.
Then doubtlesse he had been of force,
whose carefull care was suche:
As peace to winne to Irishe soile,
he demde no trauaill muche,
*But care he takes both night and daie,
and meanes that he did vse:
Might make this gracelesse cursed race,
their euill liues refuse.
*The more he seeketh them to win
the further of thei straie:
As ympes that doe detest to walke
the high and pleasant waie:
I cease I cease more to relate,
their stratagemes to showe:
Till place and space and heauenly grace,
shall fitter tyme bestowe.

SIG
And to conclude this formoste part
herein I make an ende:
Supposyng loiall subiectes minds
in nought I doe offende.
Though pictures, and protractours made,
by Painters cunnyng skill:
With gestures of the Irishe Karne
set out by quiu'ryng quill.
I publisht haue, wherby the world
maie knowe their inclination:
As how thei passe for wicked life,
the synfulste generation.
And if for want of better arte,
some things I pretermitte:
Whiche rightly here to this discourse,
might be adioyned fitte.
*Let pacience Lordings yet supplie,
the things so doen amisse:
Or let correctyng of the faltes,
amende that faltie is.
At least declare when you haue redde,
in what I haue offended:
And if it resteth in my handes,
it shalbe then amended,
FINIS.
