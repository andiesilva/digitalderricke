SIG K3v
The Aucthors exhortation.
Come eche wight, whiche now do haunt the wood,
Submit your selues, vnto your soueraignes lawe,
Come forthe I saie, receiue my councell good:
Let not fonde luste, your sences thence withdrawe,
But of the croune, like subiectes stande in awe.
So shall you finde, suche fauour of the Queene:
As hetherto, the like you haue not scene.
In steade of woodes, then houses you maie vse,
In steade of Boggs, the Cities at your will,
Procede therefore, leste tyme you should abuse:
Now reape the fruite, of pleasure euen your fill.
Let loyall loue, Rebellyng fancies kill.
(In fine) submit, you (to her royall grace:
So mercie shall, areste you with her Mace.
FINIS.
