E2r The Prolog to the seconde parte. 
SInce sacred Ioue whose royall throne,
is plaste in circled Skies:
Beholdeth thinges farr distant thēce,
with vewe of godly eyes.
And seyng that the Lorde doeth guide,
eache thyng with heauenly might:
As well the Sonne and orient daie,
as Moone in frostie night.
Conductyng them as seemes hym best,
disposing all at will:
VVhereby his creatures diuersly,
his pleasure might fulfill.
Support good God with heauenly grace,
my penne for to relate:
The seconde parte that doth belong,
vnto the Irishe state.
Illuminate my senses all,
that I maie rightly tell:
The nature of the Irishe Karne,
as how they doe rebell.
And euery thyng to showe aright,
SIG E2v
thou Lorde directe my course:
And leade me to Thelysian fieldes,
by thy triumphant force.
I seeke no helpe of forraigne Gods,
nor ayde of suche a crewe:
Because to trust in senslesse thynges,
small comforte can ensewe.
But thy good ayde is that I craue,
wherefore graunt me the same:
That I by it maie haue the strength,
a pleasaunt verse to frame.
And in the same a matter fit,
applied to the thing:
VVhiche is the chiefest cause whereof,
my sillie verse doeth spring.
FINIS.
SIG E3r
The second part of the Image of Irelande.
THough that the royall soyle,
and fertill Irishe grounde:
With thousande sondrie pleasaunt thinges,
moste nobly doe abounde.
Though that the lande be free,
from Uipers generation:
As in the former parte I made,
a perfecte declaration.
Though that the yearth I saie,
be bliste with heauenly things:
And though tis like the fragrant flowre,
in pleasante Maie that springs.
Yet when I did beholde,
those whiche possesse the same:
Their maners lothsome to be told,
as yrcksome for to name.
I meruailde in my mynde,
and therevpon did muse:
To see a Bride of heauenlie hewe,
an ouglie Feere to chuse.
This Bride it is the Soile,
the Bridegrome is the Karne,
With writhed glibbes like wicked Sprits,*
with visage rough and stearne.
With sculles vpon their poules,
in steade of ciuill Cappes:
SIG E3v
With speares in hand and swordes by sides,
to beare of after clappes.
With Iackettes long and large,
whiche shroude simplicitie:
Though spitfull dartes which thei do beare
importe iniquitie.
*Their shirtes be verie straunge,
not reachyng paste the thie;
With pleates on pleates thei pleated are,
as thicke as pleates maie lye.
Whose sleues hang trailing doune
almoste vnto the Shoe:
And with a Mantell commonlie,
the Irishe Karne doe goe.
Now some emongest the reste,
doe vse an other weede:
A coate I meane of strange deuice,
whiche fancie first did breede.
His skirtes be verie shorte,
with pleates set thicke about,
And Irishe trouzes more to put,
their straunge protractours out
Loe Lordynges here the draught,
sett out in open vewe:
For by instructions I am taught.
false forgynges to eschewe▪
SIG E4r
Like as their weedes be straunge,
and monstrous to beholde:
So doe their maners far surpasse,*
them all a thousande folde.
For thei are tearmed wilde,
Woodkarne thei haue to name:
And meruaile not though strange it be,
for thei dosarne the same.
In maners thei be rude,
and monstrous eke in fashon:
Their dealynges also do bewraie,*
a crooked generation.
For why, thei feare not God,
nor honour yet their Prince:*
Whom by the lawes of mightie Ioue
thei ought to reuerence.
Eche theef would be a Lorde,*
to rule euen by a becke,
The faithfull subiectes often times
thei shorten by the necke.*
And those that would be true,
to God and to the Croune:
*With fire and sworde, and deepe despight,
thei plucke suche subiects doune
*Thus thei be mortall foes,
vnto the Common wealthe:
Maintainyng rackhells at their heeles,
through detestable stealthe.
Thei harpe vpon one stryng,
and therein is their ioye:
When as thei finde a subtill fleight,* 
SIG E4v
to worke true mens anoye.
For mischeefis the game,
wherein thei doe delight:
*As eke thei holde it great renowne
to burne and spoile by night.
When tyme yeeldes true men ease,
suche reste thei pretermitte:
*And giue them selues to other artes,
for their behofe more fitte.
To wounde the harmelesse sorte,
it is the Karnishe guise:
And other some to stiffle quight,
in slumbryng bedde that lyes.
An other sorte thei spoile,
euen naked to the skin:
And leaue hym nothyng for to wrappe,
his naked bodie in.
*Thei leaue no kinde of thyng,
that maie be borne awaie:
The potte, the panne, the Horse, the Cowe,
and muche more maie I saie.
Now thynges that are to sadde,
that maie suppresse their powre:
Thei doe commit to flames of fire,
the same for to deuoure.
*And when thei haue their luste,
the sillie captiue beaste:
Must presently be knocked doune,
to make the knaues a feaste.
*But who shalbe the Cooke:
it is no question here:
SIG F1r
Nor for the Pantlers chipped loues,*
thei aske for once a yere.
Eche knaue will plaie the Cooke,
to stande his Lorde in steede:
But tagge and ragge will equal be
when cheefest Rebell feede.*
Well, Beeues are knocked doune,
the Butchers plaie their parte,
Tho take eche one the intrails forthe,
the Liuer with the Harte.*
And beyng breathyng newe,
th'unwashen Puddyngs thei:
Upon the coales or embers hotte,
for want of Gredyron laie.
And scarse not halfe enough,
(draffe serueth well for Hoggs:)
Thei take them vp and fall therto,
like rau'nyng hongrie Doggs.
Deuouryng gutte and limine,*
no parte doth come a misse:
Whose lippes & chappes wt blood doe swim,
moste true reporte is this.
As for the greatest Karne,*
thei haue the cheefest stuffe:
Though durtie tripes and offalls like
please vnderknaues enoufe.
Whereof thei parte doe roste,
and other some thei boile:
Thus what betwene the sodde and roste,
fearce honger thei assoile.
No table there is spread,* 
SIG F1v
thei haue no courtlike guise,
The yearth sometimes standes thē in steede
whereon their victuall lyes.
Their Coushens are of Strawe,
of Rushes or of Haye:
Made banckesetwise with withies,
their tailes to vnderlaie.
Their Platters are of wood,
by cunnyng Turners made.
But not of Peauter (credite me,)
as is our Englishe trade.
*Now ere the Lordesitts doune,
with concubine or wife:
*(Whereof he often makes exchaunge,
in compasse of his life.)
Before he takes his rome,
a Frier doeth beginne:
To blesse the Rebell with his wife,
the place and theeues therein.
Whiche when he blessed hath,
in highest place of all:
The Cheeftaine then this traitrous knaue,
like honest man doeth stall.
*And next his Surgion he,
doeth sette at Friers side:
And then himself his rome enioyth
adorned with his Bride.
(In fine) the hetlishe route.
*like luckie fellowes mette:
Doe sit them doune on strawe or grounde,
their victualles for to gette.
SIG F2r
Long stabbers plucke thei forthe,*
in steede of handsome kniues:
And with the same thei slashe me out,
good God what preatie shiues.
Not shiues of bread I meane.
for that were verie rare:
But gobbes of fleshe not boyld inough,
whiche is their common fare.
Their cheefest drinke is Milke,*
for want of Milke, the brothe:
Thei take which thing ye Surgiō sweares,*
is Phisicke by his trothe.
And if that brothe be scante,
yet water is at hande:
For euery Riuer yeeldes enough,
within that goodly land:
Againe if Fortune faunth,
or on them chaunce to smile:
She filles thē then with Vskebeaghe,*
and wine an other while.
O that is cheare in howles,
it beautifith the feaste:
And makes thē loke with dronken noules,
from moste vnto the leaste.
Now when their gutts be full,
then comes the pastyme in:
The Barde and Harper mellodie,*
vnto them doe beginne.
This Barde he doeth report,
the noble conquestes done,*
And eke in Rimes shewes forthe at large,* 
SIG F2v
their glorie thereby wonne.
Thus he at randome ronneth,
he pricks the Rebells on:
And shewes by suche externall deeds,
their honour lyes vpon.
*And more to stirre them vp,
to prosecute their ill:
What greate renowne their fathers gotte,
thei shewe by Rimyng skill.
And thei moste gladsome are,
to heare of Parents name:
*As how by spoilyng honest menne,
thei wonne suche endlesse fame.
Wherefore like gracelesse graftes,
sprong from a wicked tree:
Thei grow through daily exercise,
to all iniquitie.
And more t'augment the flame,
and rancour of their harte:
*The Frier of his councells vile,
to rebelles doth imparte.
*Affirmyng that it is,
an almose deede to God:
To make the Englishe subiectes taste,
the Irishe Rebells rodde.
To spoile, to kill, to burne,
this Friers councell is:
And for the doyng of the same,
*he warrantes heauenlie blisse.
He tells a holie tale,
*the white he tournes to blacke:
SIG F3r
And through the pardons in his Male,
he workes a Knauishe Knacke.
Beholde the self same thyng,
set forthe by Caruers Arte:
With pictures framed pretely,
expoundyng euery parte.
2
When Friers tale is doen,
and Rebells waied haue:*
The circumstaunce of eu'ry worde
reported by the knaue.
From supper then thei rise,
with Friers blessyng, thei
Unto the Englishe borders next,
doe take their onward waie.*
And all in warlike wise,
the Borders thei inuade:
Supposyng subiectes for to quell,
by force of Irishe blade.
But loe whom traitours serue,*
deceiues them now and then:
Deliu'ryng them and all their strength,
captiues to loiall men.
For louyng subiectes rise,
the Captaine with his bande:
With strokes doe lode these filchyng theeues
as long as thei maie stande.
The pray the rescude is,*
and woodkarne buyes it deare:
For heddes are swapt from shoulders quite,* 
SIG F3v
a sause to stealyng cheare.
Whose heddes are taken vp,
their triumphe to declare.
And more to make their doyngs knowne,
*to Dublin thei them beare:
Now if it were a Theef,
whiche had a bloudie hande:
Or if he were as rancke a knaue,
as liu'th within the lande.
His hedde is poled vp,
vpon the Castle hye:
*Behidyng starres, as though he were,
in high Astronomie.
*Their bodies lackyng life,
are lefte vnto their frends:
To beare awaie, as to deplore,
their lucklesse fatall ends.
Thus hedlesse thei retourne,
from whence thei did proceede:
Receiuyng for their proude attemptes,
a traitours rightfull meede.
*The Frier seyng this,
lamentes that lucklesse parte:
And curseth to the pitte of hell,
the death mans sturdie harte:
*Yet for to quight them with,
the Frier taketh paine:
For all the synnes that ere he did,
remission to obtaine.
And therefore serues his booke,
the Candell and the Bell:
SIG F4r
But thinke you that suche Apishetoies,*
bring damned soules from hell,
It longs not to my parte,
infernall thyngs to knowe:
But I beleue till latter daie,
thei rise not from belowe.
Yet hope that Friers giue,*
to this rebellyng rout:
If that their soules should chaunce in hell,
to bryng them quicklie out.
Doeth make them lead suche lines
as neither God nor man:
Without reuenge for their desartes
permitte or suffer can.
Thus Friers are the cause,*
the Fountaine and the Spring,
Of hurleburles in this lande,
of eche vnhappie thing.
Thei cause them to rebell,
against their (soueraigne quene)
And through rebellion often times
their liues doe vanishe clene.
So as by Friers meanes,
in whom all follie swimme:
The Irishe Karne doe often lose,
the life with hedde and limme.
*Yet that auaileth not,
thei so bewitched arre:
The losse of freends cannot disswade,
the reste from mortall warre.
But still thei busie are,
SIG F4v
leage Subiectes to desease:
Their natiue countrie for to spoile,
and Princs to displease.
*In pleasyng whom is reste,
and thereof riseth gaine:
As in displeasyng of her grace,
procureth nought but paine.
Thei raise still fearcer warre,
*and marche in warlike wise:
Unto the feeld, with sworde and speare,
whiche Mars did first deuise.
*Thei bragge to fight it out,
their quarell iuste to trie:
*Thei sweare that all the Princ's freends, through bloudie sworde shall die.
Thus in their rage thei frette,
and in their moodes doe fume:
*Whereof doe rise a sodaine plague,
these traitours to consume.
*Our valiaunt Sidney Lord,
who gouernes Irishe soile:
Doth poste himself with Marshall knightes
those braggyng beastes to coile.
*And Captaines thei doe vowe,
who did the heauens create:
Their hands should strike ye warlike stroke,
Karnes courage to abate.
*The Souldiers doe reioyce,
to see that happie daie:
In whiche Caliuers vantyng foes,
their iuste reward maie paie.
SIG G1r
And many Irelande Lords,* beyng faithfull to the Croune:
Protest through force of horse and speare,
those crakyng Knaues shall doune.
The pot now ginnes to seeth,
the fire is so greate:
And Smith assaies with mightie sleadge,
the Iron hotte to beate.*
The daie appointed is,
the place likewise assignde:
The messenger he trotteth forthe,*
to knowe the Rebells minde.
Who makes his backe retourne,
with answere of the foe:
And worde for worde as he did speake,
he doeth relate it soe.
<i>Agen beholde the thynge
in figures well requited:
Expoundyng breefly euery point,
that was euen now recited. </i>
3
Now forward marche our hoste,
in battaill raie beset:
Who with couragious hartes goes on,
the Karne to paie their debt.
Against whom comes the Karne,
farre of in warlicke wise:
SIG G1v
*With three and three in ranckes beset,
to doe some enterprise.
Thei make a goodlie shewe,
till nere thei come at hande:
Thei set them selues moste liuely forthe,
like conquerers of the lande.
But when thei are in reache,
or compasse of the bowe:
*Doeth not the vewe of Princes hoste,
Karnes courage ouerthrowe?
Their pride God wot must swage,
where feare doeth plucke it doune:
*What Rebell would not stande agaste,
to meete the roiall croune.
*Now warlicke raie thei leaue,
and on a heape thei clunge:
Supposyng safer for to bee,
as better foes repunge.
And with a mightie crie,
our hoste thei doe inuade:
But sone repulsed backe againe,
by warriours pearcyng blade.
The Trompetts sound me forthe,
the scirmishe to reueale:
And murderyng gunnes their secret grudge
no further maie conceale.
Here bulletts flye abroad,
there dartes againe are sent:
And blowe for blowe in recompence,
to either parte is lent.
The horsemen scoures the coaste:
SIG G2r
with shakyng speares in hande:
And Rebells whiche before did boaste,*
now ginne to flye the lande.
Still sounde the trompetts forthe,
eche Souldiers harte to cheare:
And captaines with twoo edged swords,
doe giue the traitours geare.
Here lyes a Rebells hedde,
from shulders taken quight:*
And here the Lions tearing pawes
on woodkarnes costard light.
The Griphon here assaies,
to haue his manhoode knowne:
Whose valure hath sufficientlie.
from tyme to tyme been showne.
The Eagle with the reste,
no lesser honour hath:
When as his bill and tallentes bothe,
in Rebells bloud he hath.*
And all the lustie youthes,
belongyng to the traine:
To purchase fame by Marshall acts,
their azure vaines doe straine.
Now goe the foes to wracke,*
the Karne apace doe sweate:
And bagge Pipe then in steade of Trompe,*
doe lulle the backe retreate.
Who eares the Bagpipe now,
the pastyme is so hotte:
Our valiant Captens will not cease,*
till that the feeld be gotte.
SIG G2v
But still thei forward pearse,
vpon the glibbed route:
And with their weapons meete for warre,
these vauntyng foes thei cloute.
Loe yet behold a Knight,
our Princes proued frende:
In armour readie for to fight,
the quarell so to ende.
*This seekes by warlicke meanes,
his credite to augment:
And for his Prince and countries sake,
his Pistoll forthe is sent.
Whiche doeth relate the cause,
of her exceadyng Ire.
*As how her iuste conceiued wrath,
surpasse the flames of fire.
That maie not be extincte,
(signes verifie the same:)
*Till cuttyng sworde and pearcyng speare,
Rebellyng foes doe tame.
Here lyes a breechlesse Knaue,
smote iuste from coursers backe:
Thus through the souldiers doubtie harts,
the Woodkarne goe to wracke:
*Now faint the ouglie beastes,
for Lyon plagues them soe:
As thei are like to Bedlem folke,
that wote not what to doe.
*To flye thei dare assaie,
for so thei thinke it beste:
As for to stande to fight it out,
SIG G3r
their soules doe it deteste.
Their hartes are molified,
with feare thei are opprest:
And now thei waile ye thing which wrought
them this vnquiet reste.*
But will repentaunce serue?*
I put herein a case:
Or maie it satisfie the wrong,
doen to her (noble grace?)
When Lyon once is stirde,
he by and by doeth rage:
And twill be long who knowes it not,
before his anger swage.
And when he once beginnes,*
to shewe his Princly force:
He stintes not till he tournth his foes,
into a breathlesse corse.
Euen so the Irishe Karne,*
whiche doe our Queene prouoke:
Doe throughly feele by Sidneis hande,
the waight of Lyons stroke.
For why? he mailes them doune,
he strikes them in the chase:
When gentlenesse preuaileth not,*
then rigour taketh place.
And rigour beyng showne,
the terrour of the same:
Perforce doeth make them celebrate,*
her thrice (renowmed name.)
But then it is too late,
for Iustice commeth in:* 
SIG G3v
With Fortitude that (worthie wight,)
to contribute their sinne.
*Thei prosecute the chase,
pursuyng faste the foe:
And with their weapons framde to warre,
*the Karne thei ouerthrowe.
Here lieth a packe of Karne,
distracte of limme and life:
*Here headlesse Knaues abide the bront,
of warriours mortall knife.
The Karne receiue the foile,
beyng ouercome by might:
*And for the sauyng of their liues,
eche one doeth take his flight.
*The Bagpipe cease to plaie,
the Piper lyes on grounde:
And here a sorte of glibbed theeues,
deuoide of life are founde.
*Now flye whose lucke is beste,
the lucklesse man let staie:
And now bewaile thou Irishe Karne,
thy haplesse happe I saie.
*Lament thy wofull state,
deplore thy fatall chaunce:
And warefull bee against (our Queene,)
how ye your selues aduaunce.
Yea good aduicement take,
before you doe prouoke;
*The Lyon for no mortall wight,
his purpose maie reuoke.
For as he is the Prince,
SIG G4r
and kyng of eurie beaste:
So would he haue obedience showne,
from moste vnto the leaste.
Els if you should repunge,*
against his noble minde:
You might expecte at hands of his,
nought els but death to finde.
Let this a lesson bee,*
to this Rebellyng route:
To Macke, and O. to Rorie Ogge,
to all the Traitours stoute.
Let Brians fall suffice,*
let Wolfe and Foxe beware:
How with the noble Lyon thei,
the gotten praie doe share.
Still sounde the trompetts forthe,
the foe to terrifie:
And Souldiers with courageous harts,
vpon the Karne doe flye.*
The Karne apace doe fall,
like leaues through blustryng winde:
And maie nowhit vnlose the corde,
that thei them selues did binde.
Bohbowe now crie the knaues,*
and lullalowe the Karne:
And Englishe youthes a cauate sende,
rebellyng foes to warne.
Here parte doe take the Bogges,*
and some the woods retaine:
And other beyng hedlesse made,
like witlesse Geese remaine.
SIG G4v
*Thus vauntyng foes are tamde,
by gliues of warlicke youthes:
Receiuyng strokes in steede of meedes,
for their inconstaunt truthes.
*The victours doe retourne,
thei haue their hartes delight:
For Woodkarne thei are knocked doune,
the reste are put to flight.
Untruste remaineth not one,
whiche maie the least anoye:
For windes are stilde by mightie Ioue,
O cause of endlesse ioye.
*Sir Henry is renowmde,
with fame vnto the Skie:
And is receiu'de to Dublin toune,
prais'de for his cheualrie.
*Thus peace ensewes by warre,
the ende of warre is peace.
*God graunt the warres of Irishe sone,
by Sidneys meanes maie cease.
Loe Lordyngs here the draught,
of that whiche went before:
And lande discride, the wished tide,
hath brought my Shippe to shore.
FINIS.
