                  posteritie is more excellente then his antecessours, as in the tradations of

                  This is a portion of that whiche in the beginnyng was
                  alledged, where it is saied, that God was ye cause principall,
                  whereby the mynde of the aucthor was mightely enflamed to write some pleasant
                  Historie, but wiste not what, till at length by the self same cause he was
                  enstructed and taught what he should write, as more fullie hereafter to set
                  doune.The aucthour is not ashamed to acknoweledge his
                  imbecillitie, of hym self vnable to bring to passe any notable exploite, saue
                  onely that he depēdeth on Gods direction to fluishe the thyng
                  his goodnesse shall begin.Better to bee meere ignorant, then to bee ouer skilfull to
                  the hurt of other.Meanyng not acquainted in the science of Usurie, whereby
                  he might haue had good occasion and matter to write of.The aucthour still
                  procedyng on in the discription of his imperfectiō, and
                  hauyng felt the ground of his knowledge, seing him self to bee altogether
                  vnfurnished of that, which in historiographers is required (doth as it) were aske
                  a question, how it wer possible for hym to accō plish the
                  thing he gladly desired, wherevnto he makes aunswere, alledgyng though in his owne
                  eyes he seemed insufficient, yet God who gouerneth all thynges, bids hym but adde
                  to his good will, &amp; he would further hym in the reste.Three principal thinges are to be retained of euery Chronicler
                  &amp; writer of Histories, (that is to saie) Inuentiō,
                  Memorie, and pleasant Conueiance without whiche, what soeuer a man doeth is
                  altogether vnsauerie.The aucthour at last through many daies trauail, obtaineth the
                  Porte and Hauen of reste, where his three foresaid companions Inuention, Memorie
                  and Conueighaunce, consultyng together, agree and conculde that he should entreat
                  vpon the Irishe soile and inhabitauntes of the same, with the fertilitie of the
                  ground.Marke the preparation made for the aucthour, leste
                  peraduenture he might relate ought amisse, and so by false discouerie of thynges
                  therein contained, roune in danger of reprofe, wherevnto the nature of the
                  Cauiller is passyngly addicted.By these flowyng stremes are
                  ment, the goodlie Hauens and Riuers through euery parte of Irelande, most famous
                  for marchantes, in whiche riuers also are store, change, and choise of all fine
                  and delicate fishes, and that in most abondant sort, a notable pleasure and
                  necessarie cōmoditie for a cōmon
                  wealthe, and this is the firste parte cōcernyng the
                  watersAs the Riuers of Irelande are notable famous for the
                  varietie of all maner of fisshes, giuen in moste plentifull maner, so is the lande
                  farre more renowmed for her situation, pleasant ayre operation, and goodly store
                  of all maner of cattell behofefull for the lande, and for all kinde of wildfoule
                  for pleasure and profite of man, as in the discourse thereof shall spedely be set
                  out.The discription of the woodes of Irelande.The discouery of the Irish Nimphes, their pleasures,
                  pastymes, and accustomable vsages, wherein daiely thei are occupied, are
                  figuratiuely expressed.This doe expounde the true
                  meanyng of the rest that went before.These Nimphes deserues eternal memorie for their holy
                  conuersation: yea, though it were but with Asmodious the Deuil of hell: For pitie
                  it were if thei should not bee remembred somwhere and since thei are not thought
                  vpon in heauen, giue them leaue to bee had in memorie in hell.The cause why these Nimphes are worthy of suche
                  remembrance is because of ye greate paine and labour thei
                  tooke in the lande in bryngyng forth fruite after their kinde.The generation of these wood Nimphes are in their kind
                  more craftier then ye Foxes more frettyng then Bores, and
                  terribler thā Beares, working by secret conspiracies the
                  subuersion, ruine, and destruction of the hurtlesse creatures of the
                  lande.The Aucthour seing the greate inconueniences that happen
                  daily by the retaining of suche a pestiferous generation, giueth counsell to all
                  those that loue their owne saftie and securitie to ridde their handes of them,
                  least retainyng and still maintaining them they doe but foster a wolfe, and
                  cherishe a sarpent, which are redy daily both to deuoure, and destroye
                  them.The aucthour continuing in his exhortation thereby to
                  driue it more deper into the hartes of men bringeth forth a similitude of a tode
                  and a crocadill, signifiyng that it is all one equall securitie for a mā to sleepe with all those poysonyng wormes, as it is to keepe
                  about hym those members before specified, for (in cōclusion)
                  the wormes can but poyson them, and they murder them, so that bothe of them do
                  worke all one effectte whiche is death.It is a true saiyng. preuent the worste and the
                  best shall saue it self.Here the aucthour renueth his storie and
                  setteth out the operation of the Irishe grounde, whiche neither breedeth nor yet
                  fostereth vp in it any venimous beastes or wormes.Irelande tyme past, had store of all kinde of wormes, serpents,
                  and venimous beasts if fables be scriptures.Doubtfull obiectiōs, whether processe of
                  tyme, or the power of Gods abbollished the serpentes out of Irelande.Emongest sondrie suppositions
                  a very likely hoode, opening the tyme of the wormes exylement.The aucthour yeelds his
                  verdict and opinion, in this pretie tale.Good counsell neuer yet
                  hurted ye receiuer.Mars cōfirmeth Appolloes saiyng, verifiyng
                  his greate wisedome, showing reason why they should exempt feare.The reason truly set doune, for the abollyshyng of
                  feare.Bloodie Mars ouertwharteth Appollo, annichillating his reasons,
                  giuyng contrarie counsell to the confusion of the enemie.Apollo contendyng with Mars, manifesteth his notable
                  wisdome in waiyng the royall estate.The deuice of Apollo is here
                  most excellēt, who opens a meane to saue both men and
                  money.Mars
                  addicted onely to slauter gensaithe Apolloes counsell, obiectyng, it to bee voyde
                  of wisedomes forecast, not hauyng regarde to causalties that might ensue.Mars showeth reason, why the
                  Gods should reiecte Apolloes counsell, he sets out the whole rabble of ill beastes
                  bred in the lande.Mars makes here his conclusion.Apollo confuteth Mars and his Marshall reasons beyng once
                  experimented in the misteries of diuinitie hauyng fore knowledge of Iupiters
                  entent and purpose.It appeares by this, that
                  Apollo was first deuisour of the woodkarnes glibbe and mantell.Mars conuicted by reason, concludes with Apollo.Iupiter to Mars in Apolloes praise, ratefyng, that Apollo had
                  respecte, to daungers as well extant, as to those that might after followe.The order of the Irishe karnes apparel, is here allowed by
                  Iupiter beyng first found out by Apollo.It is agreed vpon, by consent of the Gods, that Woodkarne shall
                  weare glibbed heds, signifiyng their monstrous mallice, irefull hartes, and
                  bloodie hands, which moste stricktly they to this daie doe obserue.The Irishe man, contrarie to the former allegations
                  prescisly saieth that sainct Patritke expulsed the venimous beasts out of
                  Irelande, for whiche thei haue hym at this daie in greate addoration.A renuyng againe of the historie.Greate store of wolues in
                  Irelande.Irelande replenished with all

                  founde true, that like loueth like.By pollicie brute beastes
                  are brought to a peaceable order of liuyng, seruyng and obaiyng man orderly in
                  their nature and kinde, yea the very foules of the ayre and beastes of the fielde,

                  whose gracious fauour doeth protect them, whose royaltie not only wisheth them
                  good, but also doth them good, not for a day, a weeke, a moneth, or a yeare, but
                  continually, for if her Grace would their subuertion, if then she had but saide
                  the worde onely, iudge what had followed (euen vtter desolation) which thing,
                  these blinde Idiots doe not or at least will not see or consider, O ingratitude
                  moste intollerable, and blindnesse irrecuperable.No pollicie, wisedom or cunnyng, scarce altreth the wilde

                  hurtfull then Serpentes.Sainct Patrickes preachynges,
                  could neuer bring Woodkarne to holly perfection of life.Sainct Patricke is here
                  excused, who doutlesse tooke great paine and labour, if it had been possible to
                  haue made Woodkarne be come religious Sainctes.No strength maie preuaile whom God doeth withstande, no phisicke
                  can cure, whom God in his ire striketh, showing that God hath giuen vp Woodkarne
                  to a reprobate sence infectyng them also with an incurable botche.Signifiyng it is mere madnesse
                  to striue against the lorde god. Irelande hath no Pyes breeding in it.Better it were to haue Pyes thē
                  prowlers.Where Irishe karne haue superioritie, ther thei commit all

                  the order of battaile raye, beyng neare the combat, fall into a cluster,
                  therein they suppose their saftie to consiste, makyng a moste terrible noyse of criyng
                  to terrifie (if it were
                  possible) the whole hoste of Englishe men.Uauntyng Woodkarne doe
                  first giue backe.Under these covert tytles, the valure of all our English Captaines are expressed.O Souldiers of renowne shielde you
                  from mischaunce, whiche doe in spight of Irishe karne, your Countries praise

                  their labour is great.The piper seyng
                  the Karne to haue the worste ende of the staffe, doe lull the Irishe
                  retreate.Commendations worthie of
                  right, to be long to our Englishe Captaines, who neuer shrincketh, but with
                  greate valure and manhood tarieth the finall ende of the battaile.No daunger ought to be eschewed, nor labour refused, in the
                  defendyng our prince and Countries cause.The gelousie of a Prince deuoureth like the flames of
                  fire.The anger of a prince ceaseth not til he hath brought his
                  purpose to perfection.The Irishe Karnes hartes now more and more doe
                  faint.Irishe Woodkarne had rather flie then fight, and good reason they haue so to do, for
                  who would take
                  blowes if he can shun them.Marke Traiters in the midst of

                  whereunto he is addicted.Marke where vnto this Rebelles harte is
                  bent, (that is to saie) to all kind of mischiefe, sinne and wickednesse.Rorie in accusing hym self, is not to be iudged of
                  other, for here he showeth that he is as craftie as a Foxe, an extortioner like
                  the Wolfe, falser then a theef, and a traiter to the Queene, in whiche I beleue
                  hym, though he neuer swore for the matter.Rory Ogge goyng forwarde in the settyng
                  out of his dispositiō telleth that he doeth all this kind
                  of mischefe of set purpose against ye queene, who
                  notwithstandyng, laieth al the blame and falte vpon the Deuill.In this he manifesteth the great goodnesse of the
                  Queene, whose mercie is daily extended towardes those whiche are willyng to
                  yeelde to the obseruation of her statutes and lawes, but he in no wise maie
                  yeeld therto, till by compulsion he bee constrained.Rory Ogg beyng compelde to acknowledge ye great aucthority of the Prince, is therfore worthie of small
                  godamercie.Where Rorie bid the three curses light vpon him, I
                  wish hym for euery one twentie (sauyng my charitie.)A good note for Rebelles, Marks the effecte, of
                  rebellion, and wherevnto it driueth this wretched Roge, euen to the brincke of
                  desperation, who as he saieth beyng yet aliue, feeleth moste apparantly the
                  tormentes of hell, and here it is proued true, that a mans owne conscience is
                  better then a thousande witnesses.There be two sortes of people on earth, knaues
                  and honest men, whereon I gather that Rorie Ogge being banished the companie of
                  honest men, must be entertained of his like equall companiōs, (who as him self saith) is daily
                  pursued of the good in moste wofull sorte.Rorie is here a very penitent persone, whiche cōfesseth his life to
                  haue deserued death, which refused the princes pardone once offered
                  hym.Here Rorie Ogge taketh on with himself for refusing the
                  pardone, &amp; acknowledgeth hym self an asse, and a beast in deniyng the
                  same.Rorie calleth to memorie the sa
                  y
                   ing that is written, tyme beyng once past, is not easely cald back,
                  whereby we are learned to take the tyme present whilst it is offered.He verifieth and approueth the aboue saiyng by hym self,
                  whiche reiectyng grace beyng offered, now seeketh after it, but maie not haue
                  it, though with weeping he doth request it.Rorie Ogge sheweth for pardone, but maie not obtaine
                  it, for Princes by Rebels will not be deluded.Rorie Ogg seyng hym self enuironed on
                  euery side with enemies, manifesteth his miserie, showing not one craftie hose
                  or denne to be free from the knowledge of ye Lord
                  deputie, but that he hath intelligēce and knowledge of
                  it.Rorie sheweth how spitefull greedie, the English
                  Captanes and Souldiers are in chasyng and hūting
                  him.Rorie acknowledgeth ye
                  Lorde Deputies notable wisedome, onely to haue brought hym to this
                  miserie.He proueth his affirmation by a moste
                  manifest example, whiche was brought at that time to pasRorie Oges wife is slaine.Rories
                  frendes to the nomber of sixtene are saine in a cabbin, beyng in a Wood of the
                  Englishe men, and after warde the cabbin beyng set on fire, all their bodies
                  are burned also.Rorie Ogg beyng at that tyme in
                  the foresaied cabbin, with those that were killed hardly escapeth, though not
                  without a good knocke of a halbert vpon his costarde.To leape well is very necessarie sometyme, as appeareth here
                  by Rorie Ogge.Rorie here showeth that the Englishe men, were very sory for
                  his escape out of the cabbin, and from their handes. This happines is to be
                  referred to the Englishe men, whose chaunce was to kill those rebellious
                  knaues. Rorie Ogge especially doth be waile the death of one Shaune Macke Rorie Reagh aboue ye rest that were slaine
                  at ye tyme.Here he setteth out ye cause why he so
                  deploreth his destenie.Rorie Ogge being be reaued of his counsellers, is all moste
                  out of his wittes.When Rebels lacke fawterers and helpers,
                  thē fall they to miserie.The first steppe to Rories miserie.The Lord Deputie is
                  in armour against Rorie Ogge, whose fame is spread vniuersaly through out the
                  Realme of Irelande.Sir Henry Sidney encreaseth Rorie Oges
                  miserie, and worketh his subuersion by his notable industerie.

                  This H. doeth signifie, how Macke Shaue whiche is Rorie
                  Oges father in lawe.This is a true and good cōfession of
                  Rorie Oge, vttered in his extremitie. Rorie Oge is in his similitudes vp to the
                  harde eares, prouyng with manifest arguments, vnlesse he had been bolstered vp
                  by his saide father in lawe and his frendes, it had been vnpossible that he
                  should haue continued so long vnexecuted or taken.Marke here Rories reasone, whiche speaketh
                  by experience.Gods blessyng haste thou good Rorie for
                  speakyng the truthe.Rorie Ogge taketh vpon hym here, to haue
                  skill in Phisick.As the Lorde Deputie abbridged the daies of
                  some of Rorie Oges fosterers in this his visitation, so he prophesteth of the
                  ende of the rest of his said frendes together with hym self.Rorie seeth by some secret waie
                  that his prophesie is at hande, ready to be performed, and so muche the more he
                  is certaine of it, because he doeth see Sir Henry Sidney bent wholy to his
                  destruction.Rorie Ogge taketh this sithe to be the sworde of Iustice, which the Lord Deputie hath
                  plucked out of the sheath onely to do execution vpon all
                  transgressors.The Harolde of death is sent to Rorie Oge, certainly to make
                  manifest, his ruine and fall.The peace is discribed that shall be after the death of Rorie
                  Oge.The Lord Deputie in prosecuting his purpose against Rorie
                  Oge, &amp; through procurement of the saide Rories fall, deserueth euerlastyng
                  remembraunce, with all good &amp; famous men.Rorie Oge maketh here his conclusion, and
                  giueth forthe a good exhortatiō to all men, councelyng
                  them to eschewe and flee treasons, and showeth though sinnes be for a while let
                  go vnpunished, yet at length they are recompensed at full.If beastes whiche haue no vnderstandyng,
                  doe reioyce at winters departyng, and at the comming in of sommer, (the
                  encreaser of their delightes) much more ought that man, who beyng long without
                  the princes fauour, and kept in disgrace, be trebble ioyous, (receiued at
                  length to mercie and fauour)The fauour of the prince is an inestimable treasure to that
                  subiect which hath it, surmountyng pearles and preacious stones.This setteth out most liuely in sondrie, formes and fashones, what a thing the fauor
                  and grace of our Queene is.The happie estate and condition of good subiects, is with out
                  all comparisons.In deede, I think if there were any grace at al in hym,
                  whiche is once brought to be a subiecte, he maie not lightly be turned to be a
                  Rebel again.Truly the condition of Rebelles in
                  Irelande is very ticklish, and their chaunces very harde, as in this parte is discribed.A most plain and true discription
                  of Rebelles timerosirie.Feare euery while and where, troubleth
                  the Rebell, waking, sleepyng, and at all tymes and seasons.The traiter that thinketh hym self in
                  moste securitie, is often tymes brought into greatest perplexitie, such an
                  horrible thing is treasone.
                  Rebellion is 
                  a
                   very foolish plaie and pastyme, and moste foolish is he, that filleth his hart and
                  stomack with treason as if it were with moste holsome
                  meatThose that liue well, and loue well their Prince, is euery
                  wher counted happie &amp; blessed.This is the protestation of O Neale to the Lorde
                  Deputie.This is largely profferd of hym.O Neale promiseth to expell al Scots out of
                  the North of Irelande, if the Queenes Maiestie would but giue hym ayde, or if
                  her grace would haue it so.Meanyng Sir Henry Sidney, to whom O Neale
                  made like protestation.An admonition to the enhabitantes and
                  borderers neare to the NorthO Neale promiseth not onely to be a
                  scourdge to the euill liuers and disturbers of her Maiesties people, but also a
                  frende and helper of her good subiectes to the vttermost of his powre.In this part
                  Rorie Oge showeth the state of that man to be sure, so long as he kepeth hym
                  self dutifull to his Prince and Countrie.That man whiche casteth of feare falleth
                  into many mischefes.He that hath wicked rancour in his breast,
                  hath with it also a greate nomber of euill vices. Tyme is a detectour of
                  treasone.Treason espied, is execused by
                  reasone.That traiter which is wilfully giuen to plaie the Rebell,
                  hath neuer regard to the cause be it good or bad, for whiche he
                  riseth.A Rebell doeth not remember what is the ende of his treasons.Though fortune doeth fauer the traitour for a while, yet at
                  last she leaueth hym in the bryers.Many 
                  what
                   founde fo
                  r
                  tune very dec
                  e
                  iptfull.To augment the miserie of man, fortune doeth some tyme seeme frendly, riddyng him
                  out of one
                  small trouble, to bryng hym in to fowre greater, and then bids hym
                  adewe.Rorie Oge is a sufficient
                  witnesse, to tell of Dame Fortunes variablenes.Marke how fortune did fauer Rorie Oge,
                  accordyng to his owne setyng, who beyng to muche besotted therwith, fell to
                  vtter confusion and shame at last.
                  
                  Rorie
                   Oge gathereth eight score men to maintaine his knauerie.Rorie Oge troubleth both Toune and Country with his Karne,
                  and setteth more then a hundred houses on fire in one night.Rorie Oge maketh the Farmers of Leasse to giue ouer their
                  plowing, by reasone of his daily robbing and burning.The iust Iustice of God permitteth not Rorie Oge to rage
                  still on in his furie, but calyng hym to accompt yeildeth hym his
                  duetie.Rorie Oge hed is sert vppon the top of
                  the Castel of Dublin, for a spectakle to all the whole lande.Rorie Oge maketh
                  here his conclusiō and giueth wholsome counsel more better
                  then he euer could take, how they attempt any thyng that might be preiudiciall
                  to the prince, for feare of like distruction.</span></div>
