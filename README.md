# Digital Derricke
A digital edition of John Derricke's *The Image of Irelande, with a Discoverie of Woodkarne*. This repository is licensed under a [CC BY-NC-SA Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode).  
  
  
The purpose of the project is to preserve a rare 16th-century text, John Derrickeâ€™s *Image of Irelande, with a Discoverie of the Woodkarne* (1581), of which only one complete edition exists. While this notion of preservation would include keeping this full Image intact, it primarily relies on preservation through textual availability and enhancement. That is, this digital edition will preserve the text by making it more easily readable, navigable, freely accessible to readers, both students and scholars alike. *The Image* is a deeply layered text, which includes three parts (two poems and one prose) and extensive marginalia and paratexts as well as 12 illustrations considered to be the first early modern first-hand account of Irish customs and culture. The edition will be of use to scholars and students who do not have access to the (paywalled) *Early English Books Online* (EEBO) version; are not familiar with black letter; or who may be seeking to further their analyses of the text with the aid of a cleanly transcribed copy.
